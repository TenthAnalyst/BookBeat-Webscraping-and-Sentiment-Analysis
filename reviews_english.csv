"Good story, but stylish language, especially when the people in the book talk. ',' An exciting book, and thanks to Kristina's pleasant voice, which gives both shivers, inner pictures, makes it very easy to go on Eira's incredible journey🥰 pillar After the continuation and magic 🤩active, 'Fantastic book !! Longing for part two. ',' Exciting, strange end. ',' Very good ',' wonderful book! ',' Exciting, waiting for the next book 😍 ',' super exciting, looking forward to the sequel! ',' Fantastic ',' Although this can be classified as a youth novel, I, as an adult, get more out more than I often get from the horror novels that are intended for adult audiences. It arouses a space for imagination that I have not experienced since I read books in my teens and early adulthood. Highly recommend this book. The author reads the book on such a good and soothing seen that you can listen to her for hours ❤️ ',' which book, completely in my taste. An easy -to -read but beautiful fluid language. Nintriger that builds up the more you read. Nupptappingen at the end made it difficult to put away. It makes it crawl under the skin. You end up with the characters there and then. Neira Martell girl of the darkness is suitable for a younger audience, young adults but also aunts like me. / Sofie ',' I have a hard time finding words after reading the book. I felt it would be good but this good? Jisses! A several hundred year old Grimoire that only the girl of the darkness can open. A young man with a horrible past who for some reason is drawn to Eira and at the same time collaborates with men who do not seem honest nnalling I wish in a darker fantasy I got in this book and what cliffhanger it left me in then. Give me book two now ',' Kristina has the ability to write a book that makes one long for more. In part, the cliffhanger, which she leaves us with a big reason for it, is also how Kristina wizards us with her words. The one in the first chapter we know that we will be able to follow on a journey with many roads, but in the end all these roads will lead to the same place. Noch what a trip it will be. We go through rugged tension, nasty spirits and flashbacks that give us answers to all our questions. A mystery that is built up and that is with the last word. But the book is so much more about than being frightened, it is about friendship, family and secrets. And the environments feel so beautiful. Nightly, it feels like I'm in a spiritual wind between Disa's stone circle and the presence of many spirits in different eras is with me. "", 'Exciting"" mysrys "". It ends so exciting that I would have liked to have the continuation at once. It's a little horror, but rather ""Mysrys"". """

"So good! Readers make the book even better and more creepy. ',' 😀actually '', 'unusual story that raises many thoughts about getting old and a desire not to end up on the pine shadow. Recommended ',' super exciting 😃EL '', 'totally okay', 'The most terrifying in Mats Strandberg's home is not the supernatural elements the book contains, and which should not be revealed here. Instead, it is probably completely realistic depiction of Swedish elderly care. It hurts to read.nnstrandberg is a master of dialogue that feels credible, genuine, natural. The figures and their mutual relationships are sensitively drawn. It is a nice and sad and nasty book, skilfully read by Johan Ehn.ne supernatural elements I could have personally been able to be without, even though I understand that they can be interpreted in several ways and that the book without them had become a completely different one. At the beginning of the book's second half, the story is swaying something in excitement and pace, it gets a bit tough for a while, and then gradually gas against the resolution. These minor objections, despite, I think the home is a particularly reading and hearing novel, and I would like to recommend it.

"Fantastic ending ',' 😊 ',' think the series is pretty good, but it feels a bit like a reprise of the Mortal Engines series.

"I really liked the story. Had wanted a little more romance but it feels like it could be more in the sequel. A little tough in the beginning but about 25% in it took off and after that it was not possible to stop listening. I definitely prefer the ""From Blood and Ash"" series but will definitely listen clearly to this series. The reader was good but I annoys a bit on her ""male"" voices. Everyone sounded the same and with a rough sound that I didn't really think suited all the characters. She made the female voices great! ',' Good! ',' I Loved it! '"

"A third into the book I understood that it would be one of my favorites, then just got better. A fascinating world, the most well -written human characters I read in a long time and complex and multifaceted relationships between people. About the cruelty of man and the world, about the desire to live after all, about injustice and stones and broken people. Nnfantastic book, cannot recommend it enough. (But if you are looking for a book with romance and joy in the center this is not it) ',' unexpectedly good! Interesting language and pretty nice characters. Sometimes reminds a bit of Sorokin's snowstorm. ',' A little tough reading for my taste but listens in 1.25 because then the reading will be perfect for me. Nbra book that felt a little messy to begin with but after a while, he explained himself. ',' Overall a good book in the sci-fi genre! It was a little difficult to get into as there were many concepts and phenomena you had to understand. To be a whole book, it doesn't happen so much, but it feels most like a foreplay for the next book, but still worth reading. When you read the book you do not know until the end that there is actually not so much that happens so it is still exciting and in some parts you could not tear it away. However, the book requires that you read a lot between the lines and some things you wish you were a little more obvious sometimes (but it might just build the excitement ...) ',' Best I listened to ',' fantastic good book, but frustrating slow reading ( 1.25 speed worked well!) ',' Really good. 👌 ',' tough book. Many hours in before it started to get interesting. A little messy story. Good imagination that holds together and that has lots of potential, but readers are tough and the story is told in a way that it feels like it is a single character that tells everything so it rarely becomes dialogues. ntror that this is best as a reading book.
